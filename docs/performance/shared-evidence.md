# Shared evidence ownership work

Branch: `perf/shared-evidence-store`. Base: fetched `main`
`045d4ac331babca8dbc8d33867d7044861ee70a2`. The clone-stabilization
prerequisites are already merged into this base; no feature history is imported.
The optional in-process-analysis proposal is absent from this checkout.

## Local baseline

Linux aarch64, cgroup CPU quota 8 cores, memory limit 16 GiB, pinned
nightly-2026-09-30 (`5c543b0b8`), locked dependencies, unoptimized example
profile. Build time is excluded. One process, no concurrent test workload,
warm build artifacts. Input is the retained 830,724-byte, 21-function
pre-helper-certification snapshot described in clone-stabilization.md:
`/tmp/rstyle-perf-inherent-raw/1595339-pre-helper-certification.json`.
This sandbox-local artifact is not a portable regression fixture.

Command: `/usr/bin/time -v timeout 120 target/debug/examples/helper_replay
<snapshot> --generated`, with detailed instrumentation disabled. One observation:
26.17 seconds wall time, 26.09 seconds user CPU, 118,708 KiB peak RSS. The
helper stage completed for all 21 functions; this is not full production or
matching acceptance. Logs: `/tmp/rstyle-shared-before-replay.{json,log}`.
Historical measurements are not used as a comparative baseline.

Baseline wrappers both complete successfully: 1,782 functions and zero style
violations; zero actionable pattern candidates, with 17 existing reviewed
ignores. Reports: `/tmp/rstyle-shared-baseline-style.json` and
`/tmp/rstyle-shared-baseline-patterns.log`. The initial wrapper invocation
failed because Cargo was absent from PATH; the successful runs explicitly add
`/home/dev/.cargo/bin` to PATH.

Code inspection confirms that capture clones prepared frontend trees and
completed dependencies, verification copies serialized PDG/CFG buffers, and
admission clones both complete documents. The per-call JSON transport still
expands dependencies on decode. Counts of those structural operations are
code observations, not measured allocation totals.
