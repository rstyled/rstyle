# Compiler advisory reuse

`clones --extraction-profile hir-data-v3 --compiler-advisory` captures the existing
Rust style observations during the same compiler invocation. It calls the driver
mutation collector (`ExprUseVisitor`) and effect/call/parameter-use collector,
then passes their `FnFacts` to `rstyle_core::evaluate`. That evaluator supplies
rule policy, bounded call-graph propagation, fix groups and parameter stacking.
There is no second implementation of those algorithms and no strict clone
admission requirement for these observations.

The JSON `compiler_advisory` field contains separate compilation-unit results,
source-located diagnostics and fix plans, observed statement/mutation counts,
missing-function reasons and unresolved workspace callees. Diagnostic paths are
relative to the reported `package_root`. Check and test units never merge. Raw
observations include excluded functions; the core evaluator applies exclusions
and original source suppressions to its own evaluation. The report includes its
full effective configuration.

Use `--compiler-advisory-config PATH` for an explicit TOML core policy. Without
that flag the core defaults apply; the workspace's `rstyle.toml` is not implicitly
loaded. `--fail-on-findings` includes advisory diagnostics. Incomplete coverage
still exits 2, even if assessed functions have no findings. These findings do not
yet participate in the newer saved review, changed-file or baseline workflows.
The normal legacy style command remains available.

Both the record and metric identities are versioned:
`rstyle.compiler-advisory/1` and `rstyle.compiler-style-metrics/1`. These are
compiler style metrics, not the newer source/native mutation-effect contract.
Mutable borrows count as mutation events; compiler statement counts include HIR
lowering; effect propagation uses the existing bounded depth, boundaries and
trait-target policy. Unclassified external paths are governed by the reported
core configuration. A policy density of zero does not establish effect absence,
purity, termination, or safe refactoring.

Captured observations replay through `--replay-run`, including changed core
policy, without Cargo, rustc or original source files. Runs captured without the
flag retain unavailable observations. Expansion-generated functions unavailable
to the original collector remain unavailable. Missing facts never become empty
function records; the adapter rejects omitted fields that older `FnFacts`
deserialization would fill with zero/empty defaults. The enclosing bundle and
selected compiler invocation retain the compilation context. No new hash is used.
Strict clone matching and certification do not consume this advisory record.

Cross-package graph propagation and abstraction proposal reuse are follow-up
work. The current adapter evaluates each compilation unit independently and
reports unresolved workspace callees rather than declaring complete coverage.
No legacy capability is retired by this increment.
